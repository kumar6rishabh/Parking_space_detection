# Parking_space_detection
The aim of the project is to find empty spaces in the parking lot using image processing techniques.

The project will present a very simple and easily implementable solution for recommending the best parking space to a driver entering the parking lot. The project will use the concepts of image processing to detect empty slots in the parking lot and also number them for further processing.
